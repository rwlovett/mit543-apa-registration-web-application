## Project Description: Web-Based Registration Form for APA Annual Convention
This project was developed as a part of a web application development course (MIT 543) in the Spring semester 2021 for Elmhurst University's Master's Degree in Information Technology.  This class focused on ASP.NET. The primary objective was to create a web-based registration form to replace the traditional PDF registration form used for the American Psychological Association's (APA) Annual Convention. The project utilized Visual Studio Version 16 as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for building and testing the web application.

### Key Features and Technologies:
* **ASP.NET with C# "Code Behind":** The core of the project involved building a main registration page using ASP.NET and C# for the server-side logic. This allowed for dynamic form rendering and data processing.
* **Header and Footer Control Elements:** To enhance the user interface and maintain a consistent look and feel, header and footer control elements were implemented. These controls were designed to appear consistently across all pages of the website, reducing the need to duplicate them in the code for each page.
* **Data Management:** The project included the creation of a web service that allowed the data collected from the registration forms to be posted to an SQL database.  The web service and SQL database were hosted on Elmhurst's website originally.

### Project Goals and Achievements:
The project aimed to modernize the registration process for the APA Annual Convention by transitioning from paper forms to a web-based solution. This involved improving user experience, reducing manual data entry, and streamlining the registration process.

In addition to successfully replicating the functionality of the paper form into a digital format, the project achieved the following:
* Created a user-friendly interface for convention attendees to register online.
* Improved data accuracy and reduced errors associated with manual data entry.
* Ensured the consistent appearance of the header and footer elements across all website pages.

This project showcases the practical application of ASP.NET, C#, and web development skills to address real-world challenges in a professional context.
